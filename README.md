VS code don'r read my css file
I have a problem with VS code not reading my css files.
I use Chrome. I have searched online but have not found a solution. If I open, Ctrl-Shift-I, then under Sources/Workspace my javascript file has a green dot but not my css file.
Under Sources/Page, my css file is not visible. My H2 tag has a class but it is not visible either. My files are in the same folder
Also saw that VS code adds a <script> tag to my html file, might not matter.
I have emptied the cache memory and done everything I can but it still doesn't work. What can I do? (I've also tested Firefox, same problem) Soon the computer goes out the window and I have to start knitting.
Please help meâ€¦
